========
Ask the user to enter a guess until they get it right 
(Guess an integer between 0 and 100)
  from random import randint # this is a good way to make a random number
  n = randint(0,100)

If it's too high or too low tell them
When they get it right the game ends
(Remember to validate that an integer was entered) 

NB one way to break out of a 'while' loop is to use break or quit

Use documentation, look online, ask me, ask each other...

Optional
--------
tell them how many guesses they took
entering -1 quits the game (tell them the answer)
entering -2 offers hints: is it even, is it odd, is it a square or prime number?
here is a tuple of primes
primes_t = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97)

Mybe ask the user for the game difficulty (0-100, 0-1000 etc.)
Maybe tell them how many guesses they took to get it right
