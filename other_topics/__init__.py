# in modern Python there is no need for __init__.py
# Many people still use it for convention (to indicate a package)

# the module called __init__.py was impotant in older versions of Python
# before Python 3.5 __init__.py was needed to make a package
# __init__.py was an empty module

# in VERY old Python, we used to write code inside __init__.py
# this would set defaults and scopes and values for use throughout the package
