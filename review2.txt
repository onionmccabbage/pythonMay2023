Python Review 2
===============
Ask the user for a category and also for an id
Use these to make a call to an API and show the results

This is a chance to explore Python 
- Alter these instructions to suit your thinking
- Aim for good architecture (maybe use separate modules and imports)
- Look online, talk to each other, ask me etc.
There will be an opportunity to share your code at the end

Details:
Write a new module which asks the user for a 'category' and an 'id' 
(remember to use input() which always returns a string)
Validate the user input as follows:
- The category may only be one of 'users', 'posts, 'albums', 'todos' or 'photos'
  (maybe use the 'in' operator to see if the value is in a tuple of permitted values)
- The id must be a positive integer in the range 1-8 (or suitable range per category)
After you ask the user for category and id values, build a string something like this: 
  url = f'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/{}/{}'
  (Inject the 'category' and 'id' into the curly brackets)

Use the 'requests' library to make a 'get' call to this end-point API
Tell the user what was returned by showing a nicely formatted string

Optional
========
Use 'if' 'elif' and 'else' to print different nicely formatted strings depending on the category
We need to ensure the two parameters are in the required form:
Write a module containing a function called 'cleanup' which receives positional or keyword arguments (as you see fit)
The cleanup function should ensure:
- there is a value for the 'category' and it is a non-empty string containing one of the permitted categories
- there is a value for the 'id' and it is a positive integer
If category or id is missing or unacceptable, you should provide sensible defaults
For example, if id is a floating point number or a string, try to cast it as an int()
Import and use your 'cleanup' function to sanitize the user-provided data

Write a generator that yields integers values 1, 2, 3 up to 8
Use this generator to make successive calls for user/1 user/2 etc.


If Time
=======
The API end-point includes a number of 'posts' for each user
When a request is made for a user, retreive all posts then show just the posts that match that user

Ask for a secondary category, then retrieve that category (posts, todos, albums or photos) 
for a specific user ID and display them nicely
